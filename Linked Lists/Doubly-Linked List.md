Doubly linked lists offer a versatile way of managing data, allowing for forward and backward traversal. One of the fundamental operations in linked list manipulation is inserting a node at a specified position. In this article, we'll delve into the iterative method of inserting a node at a given position in a doubly linked list using C.
Doubly Linked Lists
Before we dive into the insertion process, let's briefly understand what doubly linked lists are. Unlike singly linked lists, doubly linked lists contain nodes with pointers to both the next and the previous nodes, offering bidirectional traversal.
Iterative Method: Step-By-Step Explanation:
We'll walk through the iterative method of inserting a node at a given position, explaining each step in detail:
Initialisation: Create a new node and initialise pointers.
Check for Valid Position: Ensure the given position is within the bounds of the linked list.
Traverse to the Position: Iterate through the list to reach the specified position.
Adjust Pointers: Modify pointers to insert the new node at the desired location.
Update Previous Pointer: If the new node is not the last in the list, update the previous pointer of the next node.
Print Success Message: Notify the user of a successful insertion.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Recursive Method: Step-By-Step Explanation:
While the iterative method is straightforward, a recursive approach provides an elegant alternative. We'll outline the recursive steps:
Base Case: Define a base case for the recursion.
Recursive Call: Move towards the base case with each recursive call.
Adjust Pointers: Upon reaching the specified position, modify pointers to insert the new node.
Update Previous Pointer: Similar to the iterative method, update the previous pointer if needed.
Print Success Message: Notify the user of a successful insertion.

Time Complexity: O(n) (considering stack space)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
Conclusion
The iterative and recursive methods offer flexibility, each with its own set of advantages. Consider the trade-offs between time complexity and space usage when implementing these methods...
By grasping the intricacies of doubly linked list manipulation, you enhance your ability to design efficient and robust data structures in C. Happy coding!
